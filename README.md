# Face Authentication Application

This Flutter project implements face authentication using the FaceNet512 model, storing face data (as Float32 arrays) and names in Firebase Firestore.

## Features

- **FaceNet512 Model**: Utilizes the FaceNet512 model to encode facial features.
- **Firebase Firestore Integration**: Stores face data (as a Float32 array of length 512) and corresponding names (as strings) in Firestore.
- **Face Data Loading**: Loads all face data from Firestore upon app launch.
- **Face Data Storage**: Allows users to capture their face and store the data in Firestore.
- **Face Prediction**: Predicts the user's identity by comparing the captured face data with the stored data using cosine similarity.
